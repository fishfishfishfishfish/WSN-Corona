<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package contains the RMI interface for dealing with clients that log into the server.  A client logging in
will receive an instance of a RemoteSessionManagerInterface which can be used to get a RemoteSession (by logging
in with a specific user) which can then be used to execute queries and retrieve results.
