<p>
SRDB is an acronym for <i>SunSPOT Relational Database</i>; a relational database
system that we have written which implements the standard relational algebra. 
<p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
SRDB is a distributed relational database system that we have constructed for 
Corona. When you fire off a SQL query into the Corona network, conceptually what
SRDB does is allows the network to be viewed as one database table, and the
workload of performing the relational algebraic operations is distributed across
all the nodes. Each of the nodes provides up to one record of data also (from 
the sensors), so each node still has to process the query. Some aggregation can
not be done distributed, so in this case the processing is withheld until all
the results get propagated back to the basestation of the network. 
</p>

<p>
The {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb.Table} class represents a logical database 
table in SRDB, and the attributes in the table are all a {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.types.ValueType}. 
</p>

<p>
Relational projection is implemented in the {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb.ProjectionOperator} 
class, relational selection in the {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb.SelectionOperator} 
class, and set union in the {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb.MergeOperator} class.
Cross product is also implemented ({@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb.CrossProductOperator})
but we do not currently use it in any of our implementation. It is there so that
SRDB implements the full set of relational albegra operations, and so that future
work on SRDB may incorporate this.
