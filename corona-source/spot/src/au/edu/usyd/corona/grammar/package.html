This package contains classes that deal with parsing and interpreting of the
token grammar language; the language that SQL queries are compiled down to that
is executed on the SunSPOT nodes.
</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
Queries in our SQL query language are compiled down to a different representation
which we call our <i>token grammar language</i>. It is a very simple list-based 
language, and as such the classes in this package are not huge in size. When a 
node receives a compiled query in this token language format, it parses it, and
converts it to an executable parse tree (see {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.srdb}. 
This process has to be as fast as possible in case the query is meant to be
executing immediately, so a very simple parser is written.
