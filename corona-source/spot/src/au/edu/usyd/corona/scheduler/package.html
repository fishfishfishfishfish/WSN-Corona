<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The main scheduler of the system is found in this package, which coordinate all

The {@link au.edu.usyd.corona.scheduler.Scheduler} accepts any instance of a
{@link au.edu.usyd.corona.scheduler.SchedulableTask} to be added to it, which 
will be executed as close as possible to its desired execution time.
