The compression classes and interfaces can be found in this package, which are
used when ever data size is a concern.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
When data is sent via the wireless radio, it is compressed beforehand in order 
to minimise the amount of energy used. The compression classes and interfaces 
can be found in this package. If someone wants to replace the default 
compression that we provide 
({@link au.edu.usyd.corona.compression.JZlibCompressor}) with their
own custom  compression classes, all they need to do is make it implement the 
{@link au.edu.usyd.corona.compression.Compressor} interface, and replace the 
instantiations of 
{@link au.edu.usyd.corona.compression.JZlibCompressor} with their
own class instead. 
</p>

<p>
To find all instantiations of 
{@link au.edu.usyd.corona.compression.JZlibCompressor}, use your 
IDE of choice, or the following bash command:
<pre>
$ find . -name "*.java" | xargs grep -n "new JZlibCompressor"
</pre>
